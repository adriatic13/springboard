## Classification of human actions in videos

This repository contains files related to the Springboard Data Science Career Track Capstone Project #2.

The project comprises the development of a model that classifies human actions depicted in the UCF101 dataset of YouTube videos.

The project report can be viewed [here](https://github.com/adriatic13/springboard/blob/master/dsct_capstone2/Marinovich_Cap2_Final_Report.pdf).

The video data may be obtained from:

  * http://crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101/UCF101.rar

Train-test split lists may be obtained from:

  * http://crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101/UCF101TrainTestSplits-RecognitionTask.zip

The code was adapted (with thanks) from:

  * https://github.com/harvitronix/five-video-classification-methods
  * https://github.com/wushidonguc/two-stream-action-recognition-keras 

The code should be run in the following order (noting that directory locations should be modified):
